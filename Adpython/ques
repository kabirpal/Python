1. In Feb, how many dollars you spent extra compare to January?
2. Find out your total expense in first quarter (first three months) of the year.
3. Find out if you spent exactly 2000 dollars in any month
4. June month just finished and your expense is 1980 dollar. Add this item to our monthly expense list
5. You returned an item that you bought in a month of April and
got a refund of 200$. Make a correction to your monthly expense list
based on this



    Let us say your expense for every month are listed below,
        January - 2200
        February - 2350
        March - 2600
        April - 2130
        May - 2190

Create a list to store these monthly expenses and using that find out,

Linked List problem

    In LinkedList class that we implemented in our tutorial add following two methods,

def insert_after_value(self, data_after, data_to_insert):
    # Search for first occurance of data_after value in linked list
    # Now insert data_to_insert after data_after node

def remove_by_value(self, data):
    # Remove first node that contains data

Now make following calls,

    ll = LinkedList()
    ll.insert_values(["banana","mango","grapes","orange"])
    ll.print()
    ll.insert_after_value("mango","apple") # insert apple after mango
    ll.print()
    ll.remove_by_value("orange") # remove orange from linked list
    ll.print()
    ll.remove_by_value("figs")
    ll.print()
    ll.remove_by_value("banana")
    ll.remove_by_value("mango")
    ll.remove_by_value("apple")
    ll.remove_by_value("grapes")
    ll.print()
